## Jürgen Gmach
**Could you introduce yourself briefly? What do you do and what are your hobbies?:**
Hi! My name is Jürgen Gmach. I am a Senior Software Engineer at Canonical, working in the Launchpad team. Out main focus is the build infrastructure of Ubuntu. I am also an open source enthusiast. I am one of the core maintainers of the tox automation project.

**What exactly will you talk about in your talk/workshop? Why did you choose that topic?:**
I want to take the audience on a journey, a journey of quite some years, from the very first plans to the release of tox 4, which was a complete rewrite from scratch of a tool, downloaded more than 10 million times a year. The tox automation project is not only considered a standard, but in the open source community and in the industry, but it is a project I care about deeply.

**What would you like to achieve by connecting with the audience with the talk/workshop?:**
I want to let the audience take part of the life of open source maintainers, of their thoughts, the ups and downs, and their motivation. I want to show them a face. And I certainly want to elaborate whether Joel Spolsky was correct about the single worst strategic mistake that any software project can do: Decide to rewrite the code from scratch.

**What is your favorite programming language?:**
My favorite programming language is certainly Python. I love the expressiveness and the versatility of the language. I can write almost any type of apps with it, from CLI over web to network applications.

**What is your favorite editor or programming environment?:**
Depending on the context, I either use Vim or VS Code.

**What free software project you couldn't live without would you recommend?:**
I could not live without Linux, as where else could I run my free and open source software?

**What was your first experience with free software/hardware?:**
My first memory is that I had issues getting sound to work on Linux :-) This has become way better over the years!

**What was your first contact with free software/hardware?:**
I am pretty sure I have seen my friends working with an early version of Slackware, but the first open source software I used myself was SuSE Linux 7.0, published in the year 2000.

**Do you contribute to free software/hardware? If yes: What is your main motivation for doing so?:**
I contributed to several hundred open source projects, most notably to the tox automation project and the Launchpad project, which is a foundational part of Canonical and Ubuntu. I love how every contribution can be a force multiplier, effecting thousands or even millions of users worldwide!

**In your opinion, what is the best way to start contributing to an open project?:**
This is highly personal. Some people just choose an interesting project and start contributing. I always had a need for a bug fix or a new feature, and in order to get that done I started contributing.

**Is it your first time in OpenSouthCode? If yes: How did you get to know us?:**
Yes! This is my first time and I am absolutely excited! I learned about OpenSouthCode by a very fortunate coincidence!

**And finally, a little-known detail about you from your childhood: your favorite toy, what did you like to break, did you eat well or were a pain at the table... Tell us your story.:**
My grandfather owned a small sawmill. I loved to stay with him and ride the railway wagon, instead of going to kindergarten.

## Juan M. Tirado
**Could you introduce yourself briefly? What do you do and what are your hobbies?:**
I help companies to develop solutions that enable users to develop the next generation of distributed systems. I've participated in some startups and I currently work at Canonical. I hold a PhD in computer science and I've been a researcher at the Universidad Carlos III, INRIA, and the University of Cambridge. In my free time, I enjoy (in no particular order) guitar, mountaineering, and tapas.

**What exactly will you talk about in your talk/workshop? Why did you choose that topic?:**
I will introduce Juju to the audience and show them how deploying and maintaining complex applications can be easy. I chose that topic for two reasons. First, I work in the Juju project. Second, I want to share with the audience what are the current efforts Canonical is doing to define how software will be in the next years.

**What would you like to achieve by connecting with the audience with the talk/workshop?:**
I would like people to feel curious about all the ideas presented in the talk. And hopefully, many people will install Juju and start writing their own charms after this talk.

**What is your favorite programming language?:**
Go

**What is your favorite editor or programming environment?:**
Emacs

**What free software project you couldn't live without would you recommend?:**
Ubuntu

**What was your first experience with free software/hardware?:**
Good question. I think it was Red Hat. At that time you could borrow the 7 CDs from the distribution at the library. Why so many CDs? Well, there you had the packages and the documentation. Internet connectivity was a thing those days...

**What was your first contact with free software/hardware?:**
I developed my first free software after joining my first research group at the university.

**Do you contribute to free software/hardware? If yes: What is your main motivation for doing so?:**
I currently work for Canonical... we only develop free software. I'm strongly convinced that many of the most amazing advances in our society in the latest 30 years are partly due to the collective effort done in free software. Do you imagine sending a man to Mars using privative software...? Me neither.

**In your opinion, what is the best way to start contributing to an open project?:**
Use the project. Download, compile it, play with it. If you find any issues report them. Send your proposals. You don't have to be an expert programmer to contribute.

**Is it your first time in OpenSouthCode? If yes: How did you get to know us?:**
Yes it is. Word of mouth.

## Juanmi Taboada
**Could you introduce yourself briefly? What do you do and what are your hobbies?:**
Hello, I am Juanmi Taboada, a Linux enthusiast from 1998 and a Python developer from 2006, even if my favourite programming language is C. I am a core developer of CODENERIX OpenSource and Alioli ROV Submarine Drone. I practice yoga daily, and in my spare time, I love reading, listening to music and hiking.

**What exactly will you talk about in your talk/workshop? Why did you choose that topic?:**
I will talk about the main reason for building an ROV Submarine Drone, what design decisions I made on hardware and software, and failures during the development and my learning from it.

**What would you like to achieve by connecting with the audience with the talk/workshop?:**
I would like them to feel more confident when starting any crazy project that seems a great idea. I want to share my failures and my learnings from them with the audience. Every great project is full of successes and failures. And finally, why sharing the software and the circuit schemas with the community is a great idea.

**What is your favorite programming language?:**
C gives me life and Python extends it

**What is your favorite editor or programming environment?:**
Vim

**What free software project you couldn't live without would you recommend?:**
Linux

**What was your first experience with free software/hardware?:**
First time I tried free software was Linux, actually Red Hat Linux when I was starting studying in the University. We use to organize parties during weekends to play Quake, compile kernels and create our first LAMP servers including Qmail and Mutt. 

**What was your first contact with free software/hardware?:**
Red Hat Linux

**Do you contribute to free software/hardware? If yes: What is your main motivation for doing so?:**
Yes I do, I work in several Open Source projects (CODENERIX, RedisMultiplexer, Lanscape from Canonical and Alioli ROV Submarine Drone). I want to give back as much as I take from the community. It is a life philosophy.

**In your opinion, what is the best way to start contributing to an open project?:**
Collaborate in some Open Source projects (get it to your computer and make it work, then modify and play with it, and finally try to solve some bugs). You can also create a new project and share it with everybody; this was my first approach, but I feel I learned more when collaborating with a community.

**Is it your first time in OpenSouthCode? If yes: How did you get to know us?:**
No, I am a senior. I have been in every edition. ^_^

**And finally, a little-known detail about you from your childhood: your favorite toy, what did you like to break, did you eat well or were a pain at the table... Tell us your story.:**
I loved playing with TENTE (the old version of LEGO). I liked building robots, putting every piece together, and letting my imagination fly away. I played all day long, building new things that weren't in manuals. I always was available to open any broken device to try to repair it. I had a very happy childhood, but I was definitely a pain on the table during lunch.
